### [NLMyoüîß](https://github.com/lambda-science/NLMyo) is a toolbox built to leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to exploit histology text reports. 
## How to Use
Select a tool on the left panel to start using NLMyo.  
Here is a sample pdf that you can use with the tools [PDF File](https://www.lbgi.fr/~meyer/IMPatienT/sample_demo_report.pdf)  
Available tools:
- **AnonymizerüïµÔ∏è**: a simple web-based tool to automatically censor patient histology report PDF.
- **Extract Metadataüìù:** a tool to extract metadata from histology reports such as biopsy number, muscle, diagnosis...
- **Auto Classify ü™Ñ:** a tool to automatically predict a diagnosis of congenital myopathy subtype from an histology reports using AI (large language models). Currently can predict between: Nemaline Myopathy, Core Myopathy, Centro-nuclear Myopathy, Non Congenital Myopathy (NON-MC).
- **Report Search üîé:** a tool to search for a specific term in a set of histology reports. The tool will return the top 5 reports containing closest to your symptom query from our database of reports..
