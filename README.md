**NLMyoüîß: is a toolbox built to leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to exploit histology text reports.**  
Available tools:

- **AnonymizerüïµÔ∏è**: a simple web-based tool to automatically censor patient histology report PDF.
- **Extract Metadataüìù**: a tool to extract metadata from histology reports such as biopsy number, muscle, diagnosis...
- **Auto Classify ü™Ñ**: a tool to automatically predict a diagnosis of congenital myopathy subtype from an histology reports using AI (large language models). Currently can predict between: Nemaline Myopathy, Core Myopathy, Centro-nuclear Myopathy, Non Congenital Myopathy (NON-MC).
- **Report Search üîé**: a tool to search for a specific term in a set of histology reports. The tool will return the top 5 reports containing closest to your symptom query from our database of reports..

üö® **DISCLAIMER:** This tool use [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/). All data inserted in this tools are sent to OpenAI servers. Please do not upload private or non-anonymized data. As per their terms of service [OpenAI does not retain any data (for more time than legal requirements, click for source) and do not use them for trainning.](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies) However, we do not take any responsibility for any data leak.

This project is free and open-source under the AGPL license, feel free to fork and contribute to the development.

#### _Warning: This tool is still in early phases and active development._

## How to Use

You can use the demo version at [https://lbgi.fr/NLMyo/](https://lbgi.fr/NLMyo/) or see the #How To Install to have your own instance.  
Once on the website, simply select the right tool in the sidebar on the left.  
Here is a sample pdf that you can use with the tools [PDF File](https://www.lbgi.fr/~meyer/IMPatienT/sample_demo_report.pdf)

## How to install

- Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key such as `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
- Install the venv with `poetry install` and activate with `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Get the Vicuna LLM model `cd models && wget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/vicuna-7B-1.1-GPTQ-4bit-128g-GGML/blob/main/vicuna-7B-1.1-GPTQ-4bit-32g.GGML.bin`
- If you are from our lab and have SSH access you can pull the DVC Data (Raw Data + ChromaDB) with `dvc pull`
- If you are not from our lab and want to create your own embedding. Create a folder `data/processed/` containing all your `*.txt` file to embed. And run `python ingest.py` to create the ChromaDB (vector store)
- Run the app using `streamlit run Home.py`
